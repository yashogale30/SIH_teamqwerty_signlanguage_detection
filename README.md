## Indian Sign Language (ISL) to Text/Speech Translation System
- This project aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and hard-of-hearing community and the hearing world by translating Indian Sign Language (ISL) into both text and speech in real-time.
- By utilizing advanced technologies in computer vision and deep learning, this system detects and recognizes ISL gestures, converting them into accessible text and speech outputs.
- This solution is designed to enhance communication, foster inclusion, and empower ISL users to interact more freely in various social, educational, and professional settings.
